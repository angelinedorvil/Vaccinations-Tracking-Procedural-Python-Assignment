# Vaccinations-Tracking-Procedural-Python-Assignment

Project Description:
Vaccinations Tracking Procedural Python Assignment

In this project, I developed a Python application for tracking vaccinations among a group of individuals. The program is designed to manage and report data for three different types of vaccinations (vac_A, vac_B, vac_C) across a specified group. It provides a user-friendly interface allowing users to input individual vaccination records, retrieve specific records, view total vaccination counts for each vaccine type, and exit the program. The application emphasizes procedural programming principles and robust input validation to ensure a smooth and error-free user experience.

Skills Demonstrated:
Procedural Programming in Python: Applied procedural programming techniques to build a structured and efficient Python application. This involved creating functions, managing program flow, and processing user inputs.

Data Management: Implemented effective data handling and management techniques to store and manipulate vaccination data using Python lists and dictionaries.

Input Validation: Developed a comprehensive input validation system to ensure the integrity of user inputs and prevent errors. This included the use of lambda functions for concise and effective validation checks.

User Interface Design: Created an intuitive and interactive text-based user interface, which guides users through various options like data input, individual report generation, and summary statistics.

Modular Code Structure: Organized the program into modular functions, each responsible for a specific task, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the code.

Best Coding Practices: Adhered to best coding practices, including meaningful variable names, consistent code formatting, and thorough commenting for code clarity and documentation.

Problem-Solving and Debugging: Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills in developing the application and debugging issues, especially related to user input handling and data processing.
